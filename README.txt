I build the directory structure like so.............
./Train 	Is where the Train Images have to be.
./TrainDotted   Train dotted Images, needed a dotted image for every train
./TestTrain  	Images pulled off Training for cross validation
./TestTrainDotted Cross validation Dotted Images 
./Test  	Here for the Final Test Images
./TrainBoxed    Images dumped here with bounding boxes drawn 
                once the BB's are generated
./GenTrainImages Here in lie most of the code used for generating
                 the bounding boxes and classifiying the Dots.

./HaarClass	This is where all the code for the Haar Classifier is located

I decided to push two images up the git with the code.

TestScript.py will run the process full cycle on these two images.
Find and classifiy the dots.
Print out the RMSE compared to train.csv
Generate the Bounding boxes and draw them and place them
in the TrainBoxed Folder.
The is will load the last Haar Classifier I trained and run the
prediction process placing the result is folder
./HaarClass/foundBoxed
So if you go to the TrainBoxed you will see the Bounding Boxes Produced,
and if you go to the foundBoxed File you will see the results form 
the Haar Classifier
****Warning**** This was build to run with a python interpreter that
has the working directory as the base of this repo so it can find everything.  
Also as the porcess proceeds there will assored file dumped in to
the directory don't delete them unless you want to start the process
over. If you do start over the files will be deleted and replaced.

command: python TestScript.py
